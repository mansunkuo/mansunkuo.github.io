I recently heard a song that I noted down because it stood out to me. I remembered it again when I saw that there would be a performance at 和平島. My first impression was that the chorus was so high-pitched that it made me worry about her live performance. Overall, the song is richly arranged with some melodies that have an ancient feel to them.

The music video is something you could watch a hundred times; it's so good that it makes you want to buy some merchandise. Very considerately, it includes lyrics. I particularly like the line, "How's life? There's neither love nor dreams, right? Would you dare to never repay the money you borrowed from a friend?"
